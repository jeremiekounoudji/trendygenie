DISClAMER
A- routing
 1-never use named route for navigation with Getx

  (NEVER DO LIKE THIS: NOT GOOD: Get.offAllNamed('/certification-pending');)
  (AWAYS DO LIKE THIS: GOOD: Get.offAll(()=>CertificationPendingPage()))

B- MVC Patern
   1-Always create and use models. Create ennums for things like status,types and all other feels that need
C- Custom widget and colors
   1-always use CustomText (globalVariable),commonButton widget if exist
   2- always use predefined color accross the app. you can play with the opacity and other things, but aways use predefined colors defined inside globalVariables.dart
   3-use Utility class controller to show customsnack bars and custom dialogs. but is the design did not match, you can create a separate custom widget and use it inside a flutter natif dialog widget
